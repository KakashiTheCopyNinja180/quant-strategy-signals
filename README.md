signals/ — contains daily .csv files with long/short signals, each timestamped via GitHub commit

Signals are generated daily and committed to GitHub, which proves:

✅ Timestamped predictions (before market opens)
✅ No editing or tampering post-commit
✅ Transparent audit trail for future verification

Note: Our entry date is one trading day after the signal date.... for instance if we get a signal on 2025-06-20 then we will enter at the open of the next trading day which in this instance is 2025-06-23 due to the weekend

will update the final performance file that is being tracked after a year or so when I am ready to get in investors 
keep in mind the SL & TP is 1.5% or we close the position at EOD
